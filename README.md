# Conway's Game of Life (Backend)

This is a multiplayer backend server to the *Conway's Game of Life* (found here: https://github.com/jpenna/conway-game).

## Get Started

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set up the environment variables.

```bash
# Start the WS Server
npm start
```

```bash
# Runs npm start with nodemon (should be installed globally)
npm run watch
```

```bash
# Run tests
npm test
```

```bash
# Run tests
npm run watch
```

## CommonJs

I am using CommonJs modules in this project because ES Modules is still Experimental under Node.js 10.x (https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v10.x/api/esm.html)
